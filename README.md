# DOH - Directory Oh-no, Handle this! üéØ

**Automatic git commits for the chronically forgetful.** DOH monitors your repositories and creates commits when changes pile up, so you can focus on coding without constantly remembering to commit.

## Why Choose DOH?

üéØ **Automatic Safety Net** - Helps prevent losing work to crashes, power outages, or forgotten commits  
ü§ñ **Set and Forget** - Background monitoring every 10 minutes with zero maintenance  
üìä **Smart Thresholds** - Configure how many lines of changes trigger auto-commits  
üö´ **Flexible Control** - Exclude directories you don't want monitored  
‚ö° **Zero Friction** - Works silently in the background, no interruptions

Perfect for ADHD developers and anyone who gets lost in flow state!

## Quick Start

### 1. Install DOH
```bash
pip install doh-monitor
```

### 2. Start monitoring a project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
doh
```

That's it! DOH now monitors this directory with sensible defaults (50-line threshold) and will auto-commit when you accumulate changes.

### 3. Check your monitoring status
```bash
doh status
```

## Use Cases

### üõ°Ô∏è Protect Work in Progress
```bash
# Monitor your current project with a 30-line safety net
doh --threshold 30 --name "My Important Project"
```

### üìÅ Monitor Multiple Projects
```bash
# Set different thresholds for different projects
cd ~/work/api-server && doh --threshold 100
cd ~/personal/website && doh --threshold 25
```

### üö´ Exclude Build Directories
```bash
# Don't monitor temporary/build directories
doh ex add /path/to/build
doh ex add /path/to/node_modules
```

## How It Works

DOH runs in the background and:

1. **Monitors** your git repositories every 10 minutes
2. **Counts** lines changed (staged + unstaged + untracked files)
3. **Commits** automatically when changes exceed your threshold
4. **Continues** monitoring silently

Auto-commits include helpful messages like: `"Auto-commit: 67 lines changed in MyProject"`

## Essential Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `doh` | Start monitoring current directory |
| `doh status` | Show monitoring status for all projects |
| `doh list` | List all monitored directories |
| `doh remove` | Stop monitoring current directory |
| `doh ex add <path>` | Exclude a directory from monitoring |

## Configuration

### Set Your Preferences
```bash
# Change default threshold
doh configure --threshold 75

# Use a custom git profile for auto-commits
doh configure --git-profile ~/.gitconfig-work

# Enable automatic git init for new projects
doh configure --auto-init-git
```

### View Current Settings
```bash
doh config
```

## Advanced Usage

### Force Commit Before Monitoring
```bash
doh -f --threshold 50  # Commits any existing changes first
```

### Control the Background Daemon
```bash
# Check if daemon is running
systemctl --user status doh-monitor.timer

# Stop monitoring temporarily
systemctl --user stop doh-monitor.timer

# Restart monitoring
systemctl --user start doh-monitor.timer
```

### View Activity Logs
```bash
# See what DOH is doing
journalctl --user -u doh-monitor -f
```
